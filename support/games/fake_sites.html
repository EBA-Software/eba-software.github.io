    <h1>Downloading from Unofficial Sources</h1>
    <p>EBA Software Gaming distributes games using the Game Jolt link on our website. However, that does not mean it's the only way to get our games, but it is the only official way.</p>
    <h4>Distribution of games from EBA Software Gaming is a major violation of our End-User License Agreement.</h4>
    <p>We only allow our games to be distributed on official sources. If you distribute a game elsewhere, you will be in violation of the EULA, and EBA Software will take the appropriate actions, which includes a ban from our services which may or may not be temporary.</p>
    <p>As per the EULA, we may take legal action if it is required.</p>
    <p>As for downloading games from unofficial sources, that too, is a violation of the EULA. If you download games from unofficial sources, you risk a ban from EBA Software, alongside the risk that the unofficial game could be malicious.</p>
    <h4>Do not download games from unofficial sources. There is a chance that the file is malicious, and we cannot be held responsible for your actions if you choose to ignore this warning.</h4>
