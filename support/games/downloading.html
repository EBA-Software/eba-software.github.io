    <h2>Installing</h2>
    <p>Depending on the game, it will either be a standalone EXE (meaning you just run the EXE to play the game), or it will be an installer, which installs all game files.</p>

    <h2>Uninstallation</h2>
    <p>If it is a standalone EXE, just delete the EXE. If it was an installer, it should come with an Uninstall.exe.</p>
