      <h2>Minigames</h2>
      <p>Whenever you die, there is about a 7% chance of getting a Death Minigame. When you lose a Minigame, The Puppet will jumpscare you. When you win, Golden Freddy (from Fnaf 2) will jumpscare you. This section of the game uses the Fnaf 2 jumpscare sound effect. The minigames and their instructions are below:</p>

        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>You start in the center of a room that has a timer, score, and a gift. When you collect a gift, it adds 10 seconds to the timer.</td>
          <td>A random number is selected between 3 and 15. Once the score hits this number, you die. You also die if you run out of time.</td>
          <td>If the random number is 15, and you collect all 15 gifts, you win.</td>

        <tr>

          <td>You die if you run out of time. Along with that, a random gift is selected as the Bad Gift every round. You die if you collect the bad gift.</td>

      <h2>Timmy's Night</h2>
      <p>After completing Night 5, you are brought to Timmy's Night. You must beat this night before you officially beat Night 5. On this night, you have to keep Foxy from entering the room by closing the doors. But be careful, if you touch the walls, try to enter the hallways, or let Foxy in, you die. If you die, you do not need to reply Night 5. Foxy gets a bit harder at 3 AM. Unlike the normal game, each hour is 30 seconds. This night was added in v1.1.0, and is skipped on earlier versions. Timmy's Night does not make any changes to the stats menu.</p>
      <h2>Night 6</h2>

        <li>Freddy: Somewhat Easy</li>
        <li>Foxy: Very Hard</li>
        <li>Puppet: Somewhat Hard</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After beating this night, you unlock another star.</p>
      <h2>Custom Night</h2>
      <p>After beating Night 6, you unlock Custom Night. On this night, you set the AI levels from 0 to 20 (0: Inactive, 20: Very Hard...).</p>
	  <p>If you've beaten Night 8, you can set them to 40.</p>
      <p>After beating custom night with everyone on level 20, you unlock another star.</p>
      <h2>Night 8</h2>

        <li>Chica: Level 40</li>
        <li>Freddy: Level 40</li>

    <button class="col blue p100">Dealing with Animatronics</button>
    <div class="colcon">
      <h2>Bonnie</h2>
      <p>Approaches down the left hallway. Use the animatronic deterrant to deter him.</p>
      <h2>Chica</h2>
      <p>Approaches down the right hallway. Use the animatronic deterrant to deter her.</p>
      <h2>Freddy</h2>
      <p>Approaches down the right hallway. Unlike Bonnie and Chica, Freddy never goes backwards unless deterred. The deterrant only has a 33% chance of working. But, looking at him on the cams should hold him in place.</p>
      <h2>Foxy</h2>
      <p>Approaches down the left hallway. Not affected by the deterrant. Use the foxy attracter 3000 to bring him back to pirates cove.</p>
      <h2>Puppet</h2>
      <p>Not affected by the animatronic deterrant. Attacks randomly once awake. Keep him asleep by winding the music box.</p>
