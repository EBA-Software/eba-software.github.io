    <h1>EBA Software Bans</h1>
    <p>Have you just been banned from EBA Software? This support page should answer any questions you have about EBA Software bans.</p>
	<h2>What happens when EBA Software bans someone?</h2>
	<p>When we ban someone, that person will be unable to access our services until the end of their ban. This includes apps like EBA Command Center, and games from EBA Software Gaming.</p>
	<h2>Why does EBA Software ban someone?</h2>
	<p>We ban people that violate our EULA (End-User License Agreement). We may sometimes ban someone for other reasons (such as spamming "F YOU" in our Discord DMs).</p>
	<h2>How long do bans last?</h2>
	<p>Generally, bans last anywhere from 30 to 90 days. However, bans can be as short as 1 hour, and as long as... forever. The ban length depends on the exact violation.</p>
	<h2>I was just banned! How will this affect my application data?</h2>
	<p>It doesn't. If you're banned, your data will remain intact. You'll be able to continue using it after your ban.</p>
	<h2>I was falsely banned! How can I get myself unbanned?</h2>
	<p>First, before contacting us, you should re-read the EULA to ensure you didn't violate it. If you are sure you didn't violate the EULA, please contact us.</p>

	<h2>I violated the EULA, but the ban length seems unreasonable.</h2>
	<p>If you have any questions about your ban, or would like us to change something, please contact us. We might be able to make adjustments.</p>
