    <h1>Installing EBA Command Center</h1>
    <p>EBA Command Center must be installed before you can use it. Lets take a look at this process.</p>
    <h3>End-User License Agreement</h3>
    <p>In many versions of EBA Command Center, you'll be required to click Yes to agree to the EULA (or in older versions, Terms of Service).</p>
    <p>This is always the first step in versions that include it.</p>
    <h3>Confirmation 1</h3>
    <p>This is the first confirmation. If EBA Command Center was not found on your device, this confirmation simply alerts you of that.</p>
    <h3>Installation Directory</h3>
    <p>You'll be asked where you want to install EBA Command Center. The default directory is always C:\Program Files\EBA\Cmd. If an installation of EBA Command Center is found at the selected directory, it'll switch to update mode.</p>
    <h3>Portable Mode</h3>
    <p>This is where you choose whether or not you want to use Portable Mode.</p>
    <h3>Confirmation 2</h3>
    <p>This is the second confirmation. This gives you all of the details for your installation (including directory, portable mode...). If you selected portable mode, this is the final confirmation.</p>
    <h3>User Account Control</h3>
    <p>If you selected non-portable mode, you'll get a UAC prompt to proceed with installation. This is the final confirmation.</p>
