    <h1>Modifying EBA Command Center</h1>
    <p>EBA Command Center is an open-source program. We also allow modifications, as long as they abide by the <a href="https://eba-software.github.io/cmd/eula">End-User License Agreement</a> for EBA Command Center.</p>
    <h2>Tools you'll need</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A text editor - Microsoft Notepad will work, but it is recommended you use a code editing program such as VS Code or Notepad++</li>
      <li>A copy of EBA Command Center</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Modifying</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Open EBA Command Center in your text editor. This is usually done by right-clicking EBA Command Center, and clicking "Edit With (Program Name)" (in Windows 11, you might have to click the show more button). If you use Microsoft Notepad, it will just say "Edit".</li>
      <li>You can now edit the code. The code contains things like the built-in languages, the layout and design of the program, and all actions EBA Command Center takes. You can edit the source code. Remember, the modification must abide by the EULA.</li>
      <li>You can save the file by clicking File, then clicking Save. You can also press Ctrl+S.</li>
      <li>Be warned that if you update EBA Command Center, your changes will be lost!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Startup Settings</h2>
    <p>EBA Command Center has startup settings that can be configured in the code. These settings are found after the variables. These settings include errHandle, showDebugMessages, and maxPlugins. These settings can be changed to edit the way EBA Command Center starts. Many of these settings can also be temporarily changed using "debug".<p>
    <ul>
      <li>ErrHandle - When enabled, EBA Command Center will handle errors without crashing. EBA Command Center can display any errors it encounters as a custom WScript Error popup. If disabled, EBA Command Center will instead crash with the default WScript Error popup.</li>
      <li>ShowDebugMessages - When enabled, debug messages will be displayed. This includes messages when EBA Command Center reads/writes data, or checks a status such as whether or not EBA Command Center is running is administrator.</li>
      <li>LogDebug - When enabled, debug events will be added to the log file.</li>
      <li>LoadPlugin - When disabled, plugins will not load. Cannot be toggled using "debug".</li>
      <li>MaxPlugins - Sets the maximum plugin value.</li>
    </ul>
