    <h1>Announcement | EBA Command Center 10</h1>
    <p>EBA Command Center 10 is the new EBA Command Center! EBA Command Center 10 takes everything to a whole new level!</p>
    <h2>EBA Command Center is now an EXE!</h2>
    <p>EBA Command Center itself is no longer a .vbs file. It is now an actual EXE file, with a custom user-interface, and many more possibilities than we can even count!</p>
    <h2>Custom UI</h2>
    <p>EBA Command Center no longer follows a boring UI. EBA Command Center's UI has been remade fully, with support for various themes, and a quick access toolbar.</p>
    <h2>EBA Software Accounts!</h2>
    <p>EBA Command Center 10 comes with a new feature, EBA Software Accounts! These accounts (in the future) can be used across multiple EBA Software programs, and can be used to backup and sync your data.</p>
    <h2>Themes</h2>
    <p>EBA Command Center 10 adds themes to the new UI. You can pick from:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Light Theme (default) - A light footer and background with a black logo.</li>
      <li>Dark Theme - A dark footer and background with a grey logo.</li>
      <li>EBA Theme - A dark-blue footer, white background, with a black logo. Made to match the EBA Software website.</li>
      <li>Dark EBA Theme - A blue footer, dark-blue background, with a grey logo. Made to look similar to the EBA Software website.</li>
      <li>Custom - Custom colors! Customize the background, footer, and logo colors.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>EBA Command Center for Educators!</h2>
    <p>EBA Command Center has a new edition for educators! This edition is not free, but it offers educator-exclusive features, such as:</p>
    <h3>Custom Blocklist</h3>
    <p>Educators can create a custom blocklist. This prevents students from creating commands that match the blocklist.</p>
    <h3>Force Settings</h3>
    <p>Educators can prevent students from changing malware detection, creating new commands, logging, and anything else found in the config menu. Educators can lock any setting.</p>
    <h3>Lock Students Out</h3>
    <p>Educators can force a student to sign in to their User Account to use commands, and educators can block a student temporarily.</p>
    <h3>Special Admin Account</h3>
    <p>Educators can have special account types. This allows a district administrator to give some (but not full) access to some settings.</p>
    
    <h2>More to come soon!</h2>
    <p>EBA Command Center 10 has more surprises coming soon!</p>
    
    <h2>When will EBA Command Center 10 be available!</h2>
    <p>Right now, we don't know for sure. At the moment, we're working on backwards compatibility, Windows ME/2000 support, and other various features. We are hoping to begin betas in mid 2022, and release in mid-late 2022. Please be patient while we work on improving EBA Command Center 10!</p>
