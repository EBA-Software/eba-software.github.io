    <h3>Pre-Release 1.2-2 (9.2-pre2)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Removed the forced plugin limit of 40. The default limit is now 50 plugins, but can be changed to any number in the <a href="https://eba-software.github.io/support/cmd/config#startup">startup settings</a>. We've also removed the warning you get when changing the limit.</li>
      <li>Re-added the ToS screen when installing/updating, however instead of displaying the ToS inside of the popup, you'll have a button to go to the <a href="eula">EULA</a> online.</li>
      <li>Bug Fix - Fixed a bug that prevented commands from running when not connected to the internet.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div id="9.2-pre1" class="marker"></div>
    <h3>Pre-Release 1.2-1 (9.2-pre1)</h3>

      <li>Bug Fix - Fixed a bug where exported files will be corrupted.</li>
      <li>Bug Fix - Fixed a bug that prevented exporting at all.</li>
      <li>Bug Fix - Fixed a bug that prevented refreshing from working if the installation directory is changed.</li>
      <li>Bug Fix - Fixed a bug that prevented commands from running in the Windows 7 and Windows XP editions.</li>

    </ul>
    
    <div id="9.2-beta2" class="marker"></div>
    <h3>Release 1.2-beta2 (EBA 9.2-beta2)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Added Desktop Cleaner. This feature allows you to quickly clean your desktop. When you run the command "clean", EBA Command Center will ask what you want to do with each file/folder on your desktop. You can either leave it, or move it to the EBA Command Center Local Data folder (can be accessed using the "local" command). If you choose to move it to the local data folder, EBA Command Center will automatically create a command for it. This command can (of course) be edited in Config.</li>
      <li>EBA Command Center Local Data - EBA Command Center stores cleaned files in this folder. In non-portable mode, it will be in the Local App Data folder. In portable mode, it will be in InstallDirectory/Data/Local</li>
      <li>New Command (list) - Lists all commands in the following order: Custom / Plugin / Built-In. You can also use a parameter as a filter (ex: "list e" will only show commands with an "e" in it. Not case sensitive)</li>
      <li>Bug Fix - Fixed a bug where the Rename Command option was not visible in the config menu.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div id="9.2-beta1" class="marker"></div>
    <h3>Release 1.2-beta1 (EBA 9.2-beta1)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Localization - Plugins will have the ability to change any text that appears in EBA Command Center by creating a Language file.</li>
      <li>New Command (language) - This new command allows you to change the language. By default, there is only one language (English), but plugins can add new languages.</li>
      <li>Updating Users and Settings to the new XML format.</li>
      <li>EBA Command Centers code is being re-written (yet again) to allow for localization.</li>
      <li>The command 'debug' will act as a debug menu. It allows you to change the Modifiable Startup Settings (showDebugMessages, errHandle, logDebugMessages, </li>
      <li>Improving Logs (A new Modifiable Startup Setting will allow logging of debug events. Logs will properly log more events. Log messages can also be modified.</li>
      <li>Portable Mode - Install EBA Command Center on a USB drive, and use it across multiple devices, without making any changes to your PC.</li>
      <li>Made a change where running the installer will not give a User Account Control prompt until you confirm the installation. It will only give a UAC prompt if the installation is not portable.</li>
      <li>Commands, Users, and Settings will migrate on startup, instead of when the command 'migrate' is ran.</li>
      <li>Encrypted Passwords - Before, passwords were stored on the device in a way where anyone can see it! Now, we're encrypting passwords, which makes it much more secure.</li>
      <li>Progress Bar - During sections of EBA Command Center that could take a while to complete, there will be a progress bar. This is because of loading times during actions like installation, updates, setting languages, and loading plugins, can get long.</li>
      <li>System Restore Points - EBA Command Center will automatically create a system restore point when you install, update, repair/refresh, or uninstall EBA Command Center. This can be disabled in Registry Editor.</li>
      <li>Import from a shortcut - When creating a command, you'll have the option to import from a Windows Shortcut file.</li>
      <li>Command Parameters Not Required - When you run a command that uses a parameter, it'll still work without a parameter. This allowed us to make the following changes:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Run - You can use "run {1}", or just "run" to open the run box that was used before EBA Command Center 9.1.</li>
        <li>Config - You can use "config {1} {2} {3}", "config {1} {2}", "config {1}", or "config". Parameters can be used to go directly to a specific section of the config menu (ex: "config save true" enables saveLogin), but you can also use the menus that we've always used. <a href="https://eba-software.github.io/support/cmd/config#cmd-tree">Learn More about Parameters in the Config command.</a></li>
        <li>Shutdown - You can use "shutdown" to trigger the default shutdown method, or use "shutdown {1}" where the parameter is "s" for shutdown, "r" for restart, or "h" for hibernate.</li>
        <li>Help - You can travel to s specific help page using "help {1}", or visit the help homepage using "help".</li>
      </ul>
      <li>You will be required to log in to a level 2 user to import a file outside of initial setup.</li>
    </ul>
