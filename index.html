      <h2>Announcement</h2>
      <p>On April 29, 2022, we made the decision to completely stop development for EBA Command Center. While the project has became a much bigger thing than it's original intension was, we have made the decision to stop development. EBA Command Center 10 is not in a stable condition and will not be released unless we end up resuming development in the future. Thank you for supporting EBA Software and EBA Command Center. We hope to see you soon.</p>
