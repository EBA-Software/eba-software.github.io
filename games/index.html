        <h3>How can I enroll into the beta?</h3>
        <p>Beta versions of games are similar to Closed Betas of other apps from EBA Software. The beta for games is closed down, and only a select few can access them.</p>
        <p>This is different from Development Editions, which is a version of the app for only the developers.</p>
        <p>This is also different from the Demo and Demo Extended versions, which only have a few features/levels available. Demo Ext. versions have more features/levels, but similar to beta, is only given out to a select few.</p>
