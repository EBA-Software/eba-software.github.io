      <h4>Play Online</h4>
      <p>EBA Software offers the ability to play some games directly on our website, though we do not recommend it for the following reasons:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Clearing your browser cookies will wipe your game data.</li>
        <li>There are more bugs on the online version.</li>
        <li>The online version might be outdated.</li>
        <li>The online version requires a stable internet connection.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Of course, there are several advantages to playing online:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Less storage is used on your machine, since only game data is stored on your device, and the game itself is online.</li>
        <li>Can be played on almost any device.</li>
        <li>If your browser syncs cookies, your data will be synced across multiple devices.</li>
      </ol>
