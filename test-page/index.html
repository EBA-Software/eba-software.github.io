      <h2>Announcement</h2>
      <p>On December 21, 2021, we made the decision to completely stop development for EBA Application Manager, EBA Database, and EBA Shortcut Manager. All of these programs and their functions will be merged with EBA Command Center 10.</p>
      <h3>EBA Command Center 10:</h3>
      <p>We're working on the biggest update to EBA Command Center we've ever had! EBA Command Center 10 will include major changes.</p>
      <p>We're not releasing any of our plans quite yet, as it is very early in development, and some of these features might not make the cut. Once we're ready, we'll release our plans.</p>
      <p>For now, expect "The New EBA Command Center" to release somewhere between March 2022 and June 2022. Expected release date may change.</p>
