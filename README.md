## Our Products

### EBA Command Center

Our best product yet! EBA Command Center is a Windows application that is designed to clean your desktop, or documents folder, or really any folder, by allowing you to create 'commands' that link to them. This project was started in June 2019, and it is still getting updates! EBA Command Center is packed with features. And we have not even talked about the best part yet: It's free!

### EBA Software Gaming

An entire branch of EBA Software! Instead of Windows apps that make it easier to use your PC, EBA Software Gaming has games for Windows and Android. This branch is running off Game Jolt.

### EBA Software On The Web

EBA Software On The Web is a new part of EBA Software. EBA Software On The Web allows some of our apps to run online! This project was started on December 14 2021, and was completed and open for Five Nights at Ethans on December 16, 2021. EBA Software On The Web can be accessed on a products page if the product supports it.

### EBA Application Manager
Product Discontinued | This product will be merged with EBA Command Center 10

A project that we've recently started. EBA Application Manager will be a program that is designed to automatically monitor and update other EBA Software Apps! This program will have the ability to configure settings for other apps, automatically backup your data, inform you about the latest news from EBA Software, enable beta on any program, sync your data across multiple programs, keep EBA Apps up to date, access and install Webstore items, and more! The project was started in November 2021, and has not been released yet. This is our only project that does not allow modifications (as seen in the EULA), but this program will still support plugins with language files. This program will also be free!

EBA Application Manager is expected to release in January 2022.

### EBA Database
Product Discontinued | This product will be merged with EBA Command Center 10

Another one of our newer projects. EBA Database is an easy way to store data in a database. The project began in July 2021, and has not been released yet. EBA Database was recently worked on to get it ready for release, but the project was stopped due to the development of EBA Command Center 9.2 and EBA Application Manager. When EBA Database releases, it will be free!

EBA Database does not have an expected release date.

### EBA Shortcut Manager
Product Discontinued | This product will be merged with EBA Command Center 10

Another one of our newer projects. EBA Shortcut Manager is an easy way to get and set information about Windows Shortcut files (.lnk or .url). This project was started in September 2021, and has not been release quite yet. This program is a smaller program, and management of this program is strictly handled by EBA Application Manager or EBA Command Center. This program will be free!

EBA Shortcut Manager is expected to release 1 month after the release of EBA Application Manager.
